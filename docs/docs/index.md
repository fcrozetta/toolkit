# Introduction

This toolkit is a collection of applicaions that were developed based on my daily needs. For this reason, most of the packages are built only for mac (apple silicon).

All the tools should have a build process and be packaged in a release. In the future, maybe some tools can be released as libraries to be installed, or docker images. :fingers_crossed_tone1:
