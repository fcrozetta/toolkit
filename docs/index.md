# Introduction

This toolkit is a collection of applicaions that were developed based on my daily needs. For this reason, the main target of the applications is MacOs. Other systems may be added based on need and/or request. To request, open an issue in the respective application github.

All the tools should have a build process and be packaged in a release. In the future, maybe some tools can be released as libraries to be installed, or docker images. :fingers_crossed_tone1:
