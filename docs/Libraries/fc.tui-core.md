!!! warning
    This library is deprecated

Tui is a C# Command library to build simple interfaces.
The main goal is to have a library that works out-of-the-box, don't require any external library, and works in any console. For this reason, the windows and panels are made with ASCII characters. The default behavior can, of course, be modified by the user.

The usage instructions can be found in the repository *README.md* file. It is worth noting that This library is now deprecated, because C# is not being used constantly by me. it should, however be compatible with any .net core application, since there is nothings external being used. Unless microsoft changes the behavior of built-in console libraries, like *console.writeln()*, it should be compatible with everything.
